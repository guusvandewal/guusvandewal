👋 Hi, I’m @guusvandewal
👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, React, Next.js, Vue.js, Astro, HTML & CSS and UI

Welcome to my neon-soaked corner of the internet! I’m a Senior Web Designer & Front-end Developer who crafts vibrant 80s-inspired experiences with code and color. With synth beats in my headphones, I build grid-lined horizons and glowing interfaces that feel straight out of a retro-future dreamscape. I love bringing the analog warmth of the past into the digital world of tomorrow.

🔮 Tech Radar
	•	💻 JavaScript (ES6+) — the universal language of the web.
	•	⚛️ Frameworks: React (Next.js) & Vue.js — component-based UI magic.
	•	🌟 Static Sites: Astro — blazing-fast starships of content.
	•	🌐 Core Tech: HTML5 & CSS3 — building blocks of any neon-lit layout.

🎛️ Tools I Love

I mix and match my digital synthboard with:
	•	🎨 Figma & Sketch — wireframing in psychedelic color.
	•	✏️ Adobe XD — prototyping with retro polish.
	•	💻 VS Code — my code editor tuned to neon mode.
	•	🔧 Git & CLI — command-line synthesizers for a seamless workflow.
